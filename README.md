# 🔐 scripts_utils

Welcome to my repository. It contains personal scripts created as part of my cybersecurity learning journey (from BTS to Master's level). I use these scripts to :

- automate repetitive tasks, 
- sanitize user inputs
- experiment with ideas
- improve my logic and secure scripting practices

## 💡 Languages used
- Python 🐍  
- Bash 🐧  
- JavaScript 🌐  

## 📦 Purpose
To build a personal and reusable toolkit while documenting my progress and developing good habits in secure development.

⚠️ These scripts are simple but evolving. Suggestions or improvements are always welcome!
